Differences between Authentication and Authorization

#Authentication
    This is the process of identifying a user. It is always characterized by the user entering some credentials like; username and password.
    Where if the credentials are valid the user is then given the right to access some feaures which otherwise he/she won't be able to.


#Authorization
    This is giving users certain permissions inorder to carry out and activity. Without the permissions, the user wont be able to.
    E.g inorder to delete a post in a blog website a user must have delete permisssions. Thus the useris authorized to delete if he has the
    permissions else he won't be able to.
